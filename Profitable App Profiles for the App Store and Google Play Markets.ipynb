A similar situation takes place in the \"Music\" genre.\n",

The outcome of the average numbers implies skewness of the distribution by very few apps that accounts for hundreds of thousands of user ratings. This could be partially corrected by removing the extreme values of the few apps for each of the genres and compute the averages. However, I won't proceed with such details, as it is not necessary for the purposes of this project.\n",

The essence of \"Book\" and \"Reference\" genres are overlapping. This may carry some potential in the app idea. There could be an application for popular books with some extra features than simply a book. An added value could bring some quotes from the book, the book's audio version, quizzes or games, etc. Moreover, the app could include an in-app dictionary.  \n",

This is why a good idea would be to explore the niche in the market, by creating a practical app, like the one with the book. This idea seems to have more sense taking into consideration that we found this genre has some potential to succeed on Google Play as well. Let's remember that my aim is to recommend an app genre that shows potential for being profitable on both markets: android and ios apps."
